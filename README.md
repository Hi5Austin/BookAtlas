# BookAtlas
Around the world in 80 books!

How it works -
BookAtlas takes a link of a text based webpage and scans it for locations, and then places them on a map for you to see and read about.

Technology -
We used the Dandelion enitity extraction API to help pull locations out of text as well as the Google Map API for geoloaction and displaying
information on locations you may be taken.
